I was halfway across the bridge when I felt it—an uneasy shift beneath my feet. The wind roared through the steel beams, a deep and hollow howling that sent a shiver down my spine. The city lights stretched endlessly ahead, distorted by the thick mist rising from the water below. I told myself to keep moving, to focus on the other side, but each step felt heavier, as if the bridge itself resisted me.

Then it happened.

The ground tilted. Or maybe I slipped. It didn’t matter—suddenly, I was weightless. My arms flailed for something, anything, but the railing was just out of reach. The fall stole my breath before I could even scream. The bridge, the lights, the world above rushed away from me, growing smaller, colder. I twisted in the air, my stomach churning, the dark water rising to meet me.

For a moment, time stretched. I thought about what waited below. I thought about whether I would hit the surface or keep falling forever.

And then—
I woke up. Heart pounding, breath shallow, fingers still reaching for a railing that wasn’t there.
